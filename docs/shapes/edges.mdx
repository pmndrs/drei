Abstracts [THREE.EdgesGeometry](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/geometries/EdgesGeometry).
It pulls the geometry automatically from its parent, optionally you can ungroup it and give it
a `geometry` prop. You can give it children, for instance a custom material.
Edges is based on `<Line>` and supports all of its props.

### Basic usage

```jsx
<mesh>
  <boxGeometry />
  <meshBasicMaterial />
  <Edges
    linewidth={4}
    scale={1.1}
    threshold={15} // Display edges only when the angle between two faces exceeds this value (default=15 degrees)
    color="white"
  />
</mesh>
```
