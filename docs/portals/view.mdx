Views use gl.scissor to cut the viewport into segments. You tie a view to a tracking div which then controls the position and bounds of the viewport. This allows you to have multiple views with a single, performant canvas. These views will follow their tracking elements, scroll along, resize, etc.

It is advisable to re-connect the event system to a parent that contains both the canvas and the html content.
This ensures that both are accessible/selectable and even allows you to mount controls or other deeper
integrations into your view.

> Note that `@react-three/fiber` newer than `^8.1.0` is required for `View` to work correctly if the
> canvas/react three fiber root is not fullscreen. A warning will be logged if drei is used with older
> versions of `@react-three/fiber`.

```tsx
export type ViewProps = {
  /** Root element type, default: div */
  as?: string
  /** CSS id prop */
  id?: string
  /** CSS classname prop */
  className?: string
  /** CSS style prop */
  style?: React.CSSProperties
  /** If the view is visible or not, default: true */
  visible?: boolean
  /** Views take over the render loop, optional render index (1 by default) */
  index?: number
  /** If you know your view is always at the same place set this to 1 to avoid needless getBoundingClientRect overhead */
  frames?: number
  /** The scene to render, if you leave this undefined it will render the default scene */
  children?: React.ReactNode
  /** The tracking element, the view will be cut according to its whereabouts
   * @deprecated You can use inline Views now, see: https://github.com/pmndrs/drei/pull/1784
   */
  track?: React.RefObject<HTMLElement>
}

export type ViewportProps = { Port: () => React.ReactNode } & React.ForwardRefExoticComponent<
  ViewProps & React.RefAttributes<HTMLElement | THREE.Group>
>
```

You can define as many views as you like, directly mix them into your dom graph, right where you want them to appear. `View` is an unstyled HTML DOM element (by default a div, and it takes the same properties as one). Use `View.Port` inside the canvas to output them. The canvas should ideally fill the entire screen with absolute positioning, underneath HTML or on top of it, as you prefer.

```jsx
return (
  <main ref={container}>
    <h1>Html content here</h1>
    <View style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}>
      <mesh geometry={foo} />
      <OrbitControls />
    </View>
    <View className="canvas-view">
      <mesh geometry={bar} />
      <CameraControls />
    </View>
    <Canvas eventSource={container}>
      <View.Port />
    </Canvas>
  </main>
)
```
