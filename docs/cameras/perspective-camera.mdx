```tsx
type Props = Omit<ThreeElements['perspectiveCamera'], 'children'> & {
  /** Registers the camera as the system default, fiber will start rendering with it */
  makeDefault?: boolean
  /** Making it manual will stop responsiveness and you have to calculate aspect ratio yourself. */
  manual?: boolean
  /** The contents will either follow the camera, or be hidden when filming if you pass a function */
  children?: React.ReactNode | ((texture: THREE.Texture) => React.ReactNode)
  /** Number of frames to render, 0 */
  frames?: number
  /** Resolution of the FBO, 256 */
  resolution?: number
  /** Optional environment map for functional use */
  envMap?: THREE.Texture
}
```

A responsive [THREE.PerspectiveCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/PerspectiveCamera) that can set itself as the default.

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault {...props} />
<mesh />
```

You can also give it children, which will now occupy the same position as the camera and follow along as it moves.

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault {...props}>
  <mesh />
</PerspectiveCamera>
```

You can also drive it manually, it won't be responsive and you have to calculate aspect ratio yourself.

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera manual aspect={...} onUpdate={(c) => c.updateProjectionMatrix()}>
```

You can use the PerspectiveCamera to film contents into a RenderTarget, similar to CubeCamera. As a child you must provide a render-function which receives the texture as its first argument. The result of that function will _not follow the camera_, instead it will be set invisible while the FBO renders so as to avoid issues where the meshes that receive the texture are interfering.

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera position={[0, 0, 10]}>
  {(texture) => (
    <mesh geometry={plane}>
      <meshBasicMaterial map={texture} />
    </mesh>
  )}
</PerspectiveCamera>
```
