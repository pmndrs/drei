<Grid cols={4}>
  <li>
    <Codesandbox id="py4db" />
  </li>
</Grid>

Renders a heads-up-display (HUD). Each HUD is a scene on top of the previous. That scene is inside a React `createPortal` and is completely isolated, you can have your own cameras in there, environments, etc. The first HUD (`renderpriotity === 1`) will clear the scene and render the default scene, it needs to be the first to execute! Make sure to be explicit about the `renderpriority` of your HUDs.

```tsx
type HudProps = {
  /** Any React node */
  children: React.ReactNode
  /** Render priority, default: 1 */
  renderPriority?: number
}
```

```jsx
{
  /* Renders on top of the default scene with a perspective camera */
}
;<Hud>
  <PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[0, 0, 10]} />
  <mesh>
    <ringGeometry />
  </mesh>
</Hud>

{
  /* Renders on top of the previous HUD with an orthographic camera */
}
;<Hud renderPriority={2}>
  <OrthographicCamera makeDefault position={[0, 0, 10]} />
  <mesh>
    <boxGeometry />
  </mesh>
</Hud>
```
