A hook to obtain an array of points that make up a [Trail](#trail). You can use this array to drive your own `MeshLine` or make a trail out of anything you please.

Note: The hook returns a ref (`MutableRefObject<Vector3[]>`) this means updates to it will not trigger a re-draw, thus keeping this cheap.

```js
const points = useTrail(
  target, // Required target object. This object will produce the trail.
  {
    length, // Length of the line
    decay, // How fast the line fades away
    local, // Wether to use the target's world or local positions
    stride, // Min distance between previous and current point
    interval, // Number of frames to wait before next calculation
  }
)

// To use...
useFrame(() => {
  meshLineRef.current.position.setPoints(points.current)
})
```
