Render 3D text using ThreeJS's TextGeometry.

Text3D will suspend while loading the font data. Text3D requires fonts in JSON format
generated through [typeface.json](http://gero3.github.io/facetype.js), either as a path
to a JSON file or a JSON object. If you face display issues try checking "Reverse font
direction" in the typeface tool.

It adds three properties that do not exist in the original TextGeometry: lineHeight,
letterSpacing and smooth. LetterSpacing is a factor that is 1 by default. LineHeight
is in threejs units and 0 by default. Smooth merges vertices with a tolerance and
calls computeVertexNormals.

### Basic usage

```jsx
<Text3D font={fontUrl}>
  Hello world!
  <meshNormalMaterial />
</Text3D>
```

### With Center alignment

```jsx
<Center top left>
  <Text3D font={fontUrl}>hello</Text3D>
</Center>
```

### Custom line height and letter spacing

```jsx
<Text3D smooth={1} lineHeight={0.5} letterSpacing={-0.025}>{`hello\nworld`}</Text3D>
```

You can use any material. textOptions are options you'd pass to the `TextGeometry` constructor. Find more information about available options [here](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=textg#examples/en/geometries/TextGeometry).

You can align the text using the `<Center>` component.
