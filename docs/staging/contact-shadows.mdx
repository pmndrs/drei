A [contact shadow](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_shadow_contact) implementation, facing upwards (positive Y) by default. `scale` can be a positive number or a 2D array `[x: number, y: number]`.

```jsx
<ContactShadows opacity={1} scale={10} blur={1} far={10} resolution={256} color="#000000" />
```

Since this is a rather expensive effect you can limit the amount of frames it renders when your objects are static. For instance making it render only once:

```jsx
<ContactShadows frames={1} />
```

This component renders shadows using an orthographic camera that looks upwards along the Y axis.

It replaces all the materials in your scene with a `MeshDepthMaterial`, renders the shadows, and then restores the original materials.

The `side` prop of the `MeshDepthMaterial` it uses is `FrontSide` by default. If some of your meshes are not producing shadows, try setting the `side` prop to `DoubleSide`.

```jsx
<ContactShadows side={THREE.DoubleSide} />
```
