Applies a configurable camera shake effect using simplex noise.
Works with orbit controls when they have `makeDefault` set.
Pass a ref to control intensity programmatically.

### Basic shake

```jsx
<CameraShake maxYaw={0.1} maxPitch={0.1} maxRoll={0.1} />
```

### Decaying shake (for impacts)

```jsx
const shakeRef = useRef()
// Trigger shake on event:
shakeRef.current?.setIntensity(1)

<CameraShake ref={shakeRef} decay decayRate={0.65} intensity={0} />
```
