A box buffer geometry with rounded corners, done with extrusion.

Geometry is also available via `<RoundedBoxGeometry />` for use with `@react-three/csg`.

Note: If you animate `args` every frame, memoize the `[width, height, depth]` tuple
with `React.useMemo` to avoid replacing the geometry each tick.

### Basic usage

```jsx
<RoundedBox
  args={[1, 1, 1]}
  radius={0.05}
  steps={1}
  smoothness={4}
  bevelSegments={4}
  creaseAngle={0.4}
>
  <meshPhongMaterial color="#f3f3f3" wireframe />
</RoundedBox>
```
