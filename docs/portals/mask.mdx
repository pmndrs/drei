<Grid cols={4}>

  </li>

Masks use the stencil buffer to cut out areas of the screen. This is usually cheaper as it doesn't require double renders or createPortal.

```tsx
<Mask
  /** Each mask must have an id, you can have compound masks referring to the same id */
  id: number
  /** If colors of the masks own material will leak through, default: false */
  colorWrite?: boolean
  /** If depth  of the masks own material will leak through, default: false */
  depthWrite?: boolean
/>
```

First you need to define a mask, give it the shape that you want.

```jsx
<Mask id={1}>
  <planeGeometry />
  <meshBasicMaterial />
</Mask>
```

Now refer to it with the `useMask` hook and the same id, your content will now be masked out by the geometry defined above.

```jsx
const stencil = useMask(1)
return (
  <mesh>
    <torusKnotGeometry />
    <meshStandardMaterial {...stencil} />
```

You must unable stencil in your `<Canvas>` component to use the mask without `depthWrite` set to `true`.

```jsx
<Canvas gl={{ stencil: true }}>
{/** Your scene **/}
</Canvas>
```

You can build compound masks with multiple shapes by re-using an id. You can also use the mask as a normal mesh by providing `colorWrite` and `depthWrite` props.

```jsx
<Mask position={[-1, 0, 0]} id={1}>
  <planeGeometry />
  <meshBasicMaterial />
</Mask>
<Mask colorWrite depthWrite position={[1, 0, 0]} id={1}>
  <circleGeometry />
  <meshBasicMaterial />
</Mask>
```

Invert masks individually by providing a 2nd boolean argument to the `useMask` hook.

```jsx
const stencil = useMask(1, true)
```
