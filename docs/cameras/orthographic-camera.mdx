A responsive THREE.OrthographicCamera that can set itself as the default.
Same API as PerspectiveCamera, including render-to-texture capability.

### Set as default camera

```jsx
<OrthographicCamera makeDefault position={[0, 0, 10]} />
```

### Film into texture

```jsx
<OrthographicCamera position={[0, 0, 10]}>
  {(texture) => (
    <mesh>
      <meshBasicMaterial map={texture} />
    </mesh>
  )}
</OrthographicCamera>
```
