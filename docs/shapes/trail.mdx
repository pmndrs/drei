A declarative, three.MeshLine based Trails implementation.
You can attach it to any mesh and it will give it a beautiful trail.

If `target` is not defined, Trail will use the first `Object3D` child as the target.
You can optionally define a custom meshLineMaterial to use.

### Basic usage

```jsx
<Trail
  width={0.2}
  color={'hotpink'}
  length={1}
  decay={1}
  local={false}
  stride={0}
  interval={1}
  attenuation={(width) => width}
>
  <mesh>
    <sphereGeometry />
    <meshBasicMaterial />
  </mesh>
</Trail>
```
