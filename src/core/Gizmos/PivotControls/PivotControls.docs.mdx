## Controlled Mode

You can use Pivot as a controlled component, switch `autoTransform` off in that case and now you are responsible for applying the matrix transform yourself. You can also leave `autoTransform` on and apply the matrix to foreign objects, in that case Pivot will be able to control objects that are not parented within.

```jsx
const matrix = new THREE.Matrix4()
return (
  <PivotControls
    ref={ref}
    matrix={matrix}
    autoTransform={false}
    onDrag={({ matrix: matrix_ }) => matrix.copy(matrix_)}
  />
)
```
