<Grid cols={4}>

  </li>

Calculates a boundary box and centers its children accordingly.

```tsx
export type Props = ThreeElements['group'] & {
  top?: boolean
  right?: boolean
  bottom?: boolean
  left?: boolean
  front?: boolean
  back?: boolean
  /** Disable all axes */
  disable?: boolean
  /** Disable x-axis centering */
  disableX?: boolean
  /** Disable y-axis centering */
  disableY?: boolean
  /** Disable z-axis centering */
  disableZ?: boolean
  /** Precision, defaults to true, see https://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=box3#api/en/math/Box3.setFromObject */
  precise?: boolean
  /** Callback, fires in the useLayoutEffect phase, after measurement */
  onCentered?: (props: OnCenterCallbackProps) => void
}
```

```tsx
type OnCenterCallbackProps = {
  /** The next parent above <Center> */
  parent: THREE.Object3D
  /** The outmost container group of the <Center> component */
  container: THREE.Object3D
  width: number
  height: number
  depth: number
  boundingBox: THREE.Box3
  boundingSphere: THREE.Sphere
  center: THREE.Vector3
  verticalAlignment: number
  horizontalAlignment: number
  depthAlignment: number
}
```

```jsx
<Center top left>
  <mesh />
</Center>
```

Optionally you can define `onCentered` which calls you back when contents have been measured. This would allow you to easily scale to fit. The following for instance fits a model to screen height.

```jsx
function ScaledModel() {
  const viewport = useThree((state) => state.viewport)
  return (
    <Center onCentered={({ container, height }) => container.scale.setScalar(viewport.height / height)}>
      <Model />
    </Center>
```
