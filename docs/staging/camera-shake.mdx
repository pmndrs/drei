A component for applying a configurable camera shake effect. Currently only supports rotational camera shake. Pass a ref to receive the `ShakeController` API.

If you use shake in combination with controls make sure to set the `makeDefault` prop on your controls, in that case you do not have to pass them via the `controls` prop.

```js
const config = {
  maxYaw: 0.1, // Max amount camera can yaw in either direction
  maxPitch: 0.1, // Max amount camera can pitch in either direction
  maxRoll: 0.1, // Max amount camera can roll in either direction
  yawFrequency: 0.1, // Frequency of the yaw rotation
  pitchFrequency: 0.1, // Frequency of the pitch rotation
  rollFrequency: 0.1, // Frequency of the roll rotation
  intensity: 1, // initial intensity of the shake
  decay: false, // should the intensity decay over time
  decayRate: 0.65, // if decay = true this is the rate at which intensity will reduce at
  controls: undefined, // if using orbit controls, pass a ref here so we can update the rotation
}

<CameraShake {...config} />
```

```ts
interface ShakeController {
  getIntensity: () => number
  setIntensity: (val: number) => void
}
```
