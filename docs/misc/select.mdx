This component allows you to select/unselect objects by clicking on them. It keeps track of the currently selected objects and can select multiple objects (with the shift key). Nested components can request the current selection (which is always an array) with the `useSelect` hook. With the `box` prop it will let you shift-box-select objects by holding and dragging the cursor over multiple objects. Optionally you can filter the selected items as well as define in which shape they are stored by defining the `filter` prop.

```jsx
<Select box multiple onChange={console.log} filter={items => items}>
  <Foo />
  <Bar />
</Select>

function Foo() {
  const selected = useSelect()
```
