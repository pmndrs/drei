In order to depth sort multiple splats correctly you can either use alphaTest, for instance with a low value. But keep in mind that this can show a slight outline under some viewing conditions.

You can also use alphaHash, but this can be slower and create some noise, you would typically get rid of the noise in postprocessing with a TAA pass. You don't have to use alphaHash on all splats.
