A rudimentary keyboard controller which distributes your defined data-model
to the `useKeyboardControls` hook. It's a rather simple way to get started with keyboard input.

Wrap your app into `<KeyboardControls>` then access key state reactively or transiently.

### Setup with enum

```jsx
enum Controls {
  forward = 'forward',
  back = 'back',
  left = 'left',
  right = 'right',
}

const map = [
  { name: Controls.forward, keys: ['ArrowUp', 'KeyW'] },
  { name: Controls.back, keys: ['ArrowDown', 'KeyS'] },
]

<KeyboardControls map={map}>
  <App />
</KeyboardControls>
```

### Reactive usage

```jsx
const forwardPressed = useKeyboardControls((state) => state.forward)
```

### Transient usage

```jsx
const [sub, get] = useKeyboardControls()
useFrame(() => {
  const pressed = get().back
})
```
