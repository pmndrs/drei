A responsive THREE.PerspectiveCamera that can set itself as the default.
Automatically updates aspect ratio on resize unless `manual` is set.
Can also film contents into a RenderTarget when children is a function.

### Set as default camera

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault position={[0, 0, 10]} />
```

### With children that follow camera

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera makeDefault>
  <mesh />
</PerspectiveCamera>
```

### Film into texture (like CubeCamera)

```jsx
<PerspectiveCamera position={[0, 0, 10]}>
  {(texture) => (
    <mesh>
      <meshBasicMaterial map={texture} />
    </mesh>
  )}
</PerspectiveCamera>
```
