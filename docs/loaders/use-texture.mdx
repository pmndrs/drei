Loads textures using THREE's TextureLoader with suspense support.

```jsx
const texture = useTexture(url)
const [texture1, texture2] = useTexture([texture1, texture2])
```

You can also use key: url objects:

```jsx
const props = useTexture({
  metalnessMap: url1,
  map: url2,
})
return <meshStandardMaterial {...props} />
```
