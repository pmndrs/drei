title: ShadowAlpha
sourcecode: src/core/ShadowAlpha.tsx
---

Makes an object's shadow respect its opacity and alphaMap.

```jsx
<mesh>
  <geometry />
  <material transparent opacity={0.5} />

  <ShadowAlpha
    opacity={undefined} // number. Override the opacity of the shadow.
    alphaMap={undefined} // THREE.Texture. Override the alphaMap of the shadow
  />
</mesh>
```

> Note: This component uses Screendoor transparency using a dither pattern. This pattern is noticeable when the camera gets close to the shadow.
