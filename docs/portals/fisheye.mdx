Renders children into a fisheye projection that fills the screen.
Takes over system rendering with 6 cube-camera renders per frame.
Lower resolution improves performance.

### Basic fisheye

```jsx
<Canvas camera={{ position: [0, 0, 5] }}>
  <Fisheye>
    <YourScene />
  </Fisheye>
  <OrbitControls />
</Canvas>
```
