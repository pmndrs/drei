A [THREE.CubeCamera](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/en/cameras/CubeCamera) that returns its texture as a render-prop. It makes children invisible while rendering to the internal buffer so that they are not included in the reflection.

```tsx
type Props = ThreeElements['group'] & {
  /** Number of frames to render, Infinity */
  frames?: number
  /** Resolution of the FBO, 256 */
  resolution?: number
  /** Camera near, 0.1 */
  near?: number
  /** Camera far, 1000 */
  far?: number
  /** Custom environment map that is temporarily set as the scenes background */
  envMap?: THREE.Texture
  /** Custom fog that is temporarily set as the scenes fog */
  fog?: Fog | FogExp2
  /** The contents of CubeCamera will be hidden when filming the cube */
  children: (tex: Texture) => React.ReactNode
}
```

Using the `frames` prop you can control if this camera renders indefinitely or statically (a given number of times).
If you have two static objects in the scene, make it `frames={2}` for instance, so that both objects get to "see" one another in the reflections, which takes multiple renders.
If you have moving objects, unset the prop and use a smaller `resolution` instead.

```jsx
<CubeCamera>
  {(texture) => (
    <mesh>
      <sphereGeometry />
      <meshStandardMaterial envMap={texture} />
    </mesh>
  )}
</CubeCamera>
```
