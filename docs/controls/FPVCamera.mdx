A first-person camera system for `react-three-fiber` that mimics FPS-style movement and mouse-look controls.

```tsx
<FPVCamera />
```

```ts
interface FPVCameraProps {
  /** How sensitive the yaw rotation is (radians per pixel). */
  rotationSpeed?: number
  /** Camera height above the origin (approximate human head height). */
  height?: number
  /** Movement speed in world units per second. */
  moveSpeed?: number
}
```

## Overview

This component adds immersive first-person navigation to a `THREE.PerspectiveCamera`. It captures mouse drag input to rotate the view horizontally (yaw only), and uses WASD keys (plus optional space/shift) for directional movement. 

It automatically uses the default camera and renderer from `react-three-fiber`.

## Controls

### Mouse

- **Left mouse drag**: Rotate (yaw only)
- **Right-click**: Disabled (no context menu)

### Keyboard

| Key       | Action         |
|-----------|----------------|
| `W`       | Move forward   |
| `S`       | Move backward  |
| `A`       | Strafe left    |
| `D`       | Strafe right   |
| `Space`   | Move up        |
| `Shift`   | Move down      |

## Usage

```tsx
<Canvas>
  <FPVCamera rotationSpeed={0.003} height={1.6} moveSpeed={3} />
  <Scene />
</Canvas>
```

## Notes

- The camera is initially placed at `(0, height, 5)` and looks toward `(0, height, 0)`.
- Rotation is yaw-only for stability and simplicity.
- Keyboard input is case-insensitive and global.
- You can control movement responsiveness using `moveSpeed` and `rotationSpeed`.

<summary>Internals</summary>

- Uses `useThree()` to access camera and WebGL DOM.
- Binds pointer event listeners directly to `gl.domElement`.
- Tracks key states with a persistent ref to avoid unnecessary re-renders.
- Handles cleanup of all event listeners on unmount.
