Centers children based on their bounding box.
Supports alignment, offset, and automatic recalculation.

```jsx
<Center top left>
  <mesh />
</Center>
```

Optionally you can define `onCentered` which calls you back when contents have been measured. This would allow you to easily scale to fit. The following for instance fits a model to screen height.

```jsx
function ScaledModel() {
  const viewport = useThree((state) => state.viewport)
  return (
    <Center onCentered={({ container, height }) => container.scale.setScalar(viewport.height / height)}>
      <Model />
    </Center>
  )
}
```
