title: MeshDiscardMaterial
sourcecode: src/core/MeshDiscardMaterial.tsx
---

A material that renders nothing. In comparison to `<mesh visible={false}` it can be used to hide objects from the scene while still displays shadows and children.

```jsx
<mesh castShadow>
  <torusKnotGeometry />
  <MeshDiscardMaterial />
  {/* Shadows and edges will show, but the model itself won't */}
  <Edges />
```
