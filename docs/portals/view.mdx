Uses renderer.scissor to create viewport segments tied to HTML tracking elements.
Allows multiple views with a single canvas. Views follow their tracking elements,
scroll, resize, etc. Use View.Port inside Canvas to render all views.

It is advisable to re-connect the event system to a parent that contains both the canvas and the html content.
This ensures that both are accessible/selectable and even allows you to mount controls or other deeper
integrations into your view.

> Note that `@react-three/fiber` newer than `^8.1.0` is required for `View` to work correctly if the
> canvas/react three fiber root is not fullscreen. A warning will be logged if drei is used with older
> versions of `@react-three/fiber`.

### Inline views with shared canvas

```jsx
<main ref={container}>
  <View style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}>
    <mesh /><OrbitControls />
  </View>
  <View className="view-2">
    <mesh /><CameraControls />
  </View>
  <Canvas eventSource={container}>
    <View.Port />
  </Canvas>
</main>
```

## View.Port

You can define as many views as you like, directly mix them into your dom graph, right where you want them to appear. `View` is an unstyled HTML DOM element (by default a div, and it takes the same properties as one). Use `View.Port` inside the canvas to output them. The canvas should ideally fill the entire screen with absolute positioning, underneath HTML or on top of it, as you prefer.

```jsx
return (
  <main ref={container}>
    <h1>Html content here</h1>
    <View style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}>
      <mesh geometry={foo} />
      <OrbitControls />
    </View>
    <View className="canvas-view">
      <mesh geometry={bar} />
      <CameraControls />
    </View>
    <Canvas eventSource={container}>
      <View.Port />
    </Canvas>
  </main>
)
```
