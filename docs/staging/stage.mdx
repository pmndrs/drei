Creates a "stage" for your object with lighting and environment.
Automatically centers and scales children for presentation.

By default it gives you contact shadows and auto-centering.

```jsx
<Stage adjustCamera intensity={0.5} shadows="contact" environment="city">
  <mesh />
</Stage>
```

For a little more realistic results enable accumulative shadows, which requires that the canvas, and models, can handle shadows.

```jsx
<Canvas shadows>
  <Stage shadows="accumulative">
    <mesh castShadow />
  </Stage>
</Canvas>
```
